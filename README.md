# File_Encryption
This is a C program that encrypts files using an XOR-based cipher. A user-provided key generates a bitmask by summing its ASCII values. Each input character is then XORed with the generated bitmask for encryption. The program reads from a standard input, encrypts the data, and then outputs the data.
